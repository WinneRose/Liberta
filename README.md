Welcome to the social media that isn't behavior like governments.

## What is Liberta?

Liberta is a fully decentralized social media that works on NEO blockchain with smart contracts. Liberta is controlled and managed by users. Users decide what to be there in Liberta and what not to be. So admins and moderators are users on Liberta.

## How to use Liberta?

To use Liberta, you just should have a NEO wallet. You can use your wallet to connect to Liberta. After you connect, you can enter your information like username, name, biography if you wish. So you don’t have to register anything when entering Liberta.

You can post your texts, images and other stuff like current centralized social media. You can send any message to anyone with full encryption.

Liberta can’t save your messages, information and others. So your privacy will always be safe with Liberta.

## Difference Between Today's Social Media and Liberta

Traditional social media like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is centralized and owned by a company. Unlike them, Liberta is decentralized. Liberta just has an initial team to develop the product. After Liberta is released, Liberta’s developer team will be Liberta community. People will be able to fork the open source Liberta code and make changes on it.

**Centralized Social Media** ! User connects Facebook's centralized servers and can post to Facebook's databases.

Facebook's paid moderators check malicious content and remove it.

**Liberta** ! User connects to other users to post and save the infos to blockchain instead of a centralized databases with help of NEO smart contracts.

Guardias who are users who want to check contents, are moderators and get paid by Liberta software.

## Liberta Coin

So Liberta isn't company that is owner of social media. Liberta is a software that manage itself with help of its community. The centralized social media has authority to ban anyone if they want. Unlike that, Liberta bans what the community wants.

Liberta coin is the NEP-2 fungible token that is used on Liberta social media. Guardias and users get rewarded by this coin. Also advertisements will be paid with Liberta Coin.

## Liberta Guardia (Moderators of Liberta)

Guardia is a person who decides the content by voting. Guardias check the reported content and vote for whether it is malicious or not. The high percentage of votes will earn rewards by placing correct answers. Other Guardias get a penalty for going the wrong way.

For example;

_A user saw a malicious post that includes nudity content and reported it. The Liberta system sent this report to Guardias. Guardias saw that question and two answers to vote it._ _Question: Does this content have nudity content?_ _Answer 1: Yes, it has. It should be banned._ _Answer 2: No, it hasn’t. It should stay in Liberta._

If the content has nudity, most of the Guardias will choose Answer 1 which is the correct answer. So Guardias whose answer is correct, get awarded. Less Guardias will get a penalty like block for a question.

** How to be Liberta? ** All people can be guardia if they want to check the content and reports and get paid. But Guardia / All users ratio must be 1 / 10. So If 100 users are active on Liberta platform, just 10 can be Guardia.

Also users have to stake Liberta Coin (LIB) to be Guardia for a month. The amount user need to stake, depends on current guardia ratio. This options are required to make the fees to be profitable and block the spams.

x = guardia / users

Stake to be guardia per month: x * 100 Liberta coin

**Guardia Revenue**

Guardias will get profit. But how much? Guardias who stake more, will get more revenue. But if stake amount is so much, profit multiplier will be certain amount.

x = stake amount / total stake amount

if x > 0.01, x = 0.01

Guardia revenue: Month's ad revenue * (45 / 100) * x * right chosen of questions / all questions that came to guardia.

For example: _User amount: 1000000_

_Month's ad revenue: 2000 LIB_

_Guardia Amount: 1000_

_Total Stake: 20000 LIB_

_One of guardia stake: 20_

_Right chosen of questions / all questions: 0.9_

_Revenue: 2000 * (45 / 100) * (20 / 20000) * 0.9 = 0.81 LIB_

_For Person who stakes 400 LIB: 2000 * (45 / 100) * 0.01 * 0.9 = 8.1 LIB_

## Liberta and Advertisements

Companies can publish their ads to Liberta just like traditional social media. Ads should be paid by Liberta coin. So companies should buy Liberta coins to serve ads. Ad charges are not stable and depend on the topic and competitions like Google Ads.

Ads in Liberta are required but users can change how often they want to see ads. If users set their frequency more than default, they can get paid a small amount.

45 percent of ads earnings goes to people, the other 45 percent goes to Guardias and the other 10 percent will be burned to increase the Liberta coin’s value. ![Liberta And Advertisements](https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--rfoHr8Ip--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/945aa013-35dd-4330-9ca0-6f5f61286053/Ads_Earnings_Sharing.png%3FX-Amz-Algorithm%3DAWS4-HMAC-SHA256%26X-Amz-Credential%3DAKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%252F20210711%252Fus-west-2%252Fs3%252Faws4_request%26X-Amz-Date%3D20210711T154251Z%26X-Amz-Expires%3D86400%26X-Amz-Signature%3D7a6239c2b688108dffbba6336d7bf5acf52917e3b1e7acc6539426b6c4067626%26X-Amz-SignedHeaders%3Dhost%26response-content-disposition%3Dfilename%2520%253D%2522Ads_Earnings_Sharing.png%2522)

## Liberta's Privacy

Liberta does not keep your personal informations and your digital foot age. Advertisements are calculated with your interests in client side. That means your personal information will be just in your device.

## Target Audience of Liberta & Opportunities for Liberta

The simple answer for a simple question: Everyone, at least for the future.

In 2021, 83.36% of internet users are using social media. That amount is huge. Almost every user. So Liberta aims everyone to use it. But we know that currently all of the users are not aware of privacy, being freedom on social media, centralizing, etc. So until that, we will try to aware of people with promotions when current social media is having scandals.

We completely believe there will be issues and scandals about privacy, centralizing of traditional social media soon like old ones. And when it comes, we will invite victims of privacy to a reliable, decentralized platform: Liberta.

## Issues of Liberta

-   Little slow compare to centralized servers: Liberta uses NEO Blockchain and it is obviously little slow compare to centralized hosting servers.
-   There isn't private account option for now. (We are planning to make it with strong encryption algorithms).
-   You need NEO Gas to make an operation (post, sending messages, etc.): Because of you are calling smart contract while making operations, you need some NEO Gas.

## Revenue Model

We are planning to get profit by organizing ICOs. Liberta Coin has 100 million total supply. Especially, advertisers need to buy Liberta Coin to serve their ads to Liberta.

## Liberta Roadmap

First of all, we need to say the product of the hackathon won't be similar to real product we think. We need more time. So we made just demo to simulate what we have in our mind.

For the beginning, we just have added basic actions like posting, commenting etc. But we have future plans.

While hackathon:

-   Designing simple user interface
-   Deploying some of smart contracts to testnet
-   Completing basic operations like posting, liking, editing profile, etc.
-   Demo of Guardia user interface
-   Liberta coin's first smart contract.

After hackathon:

August:

-   Making encryption algorithm to make some posts, messages, etc. private.
-   Sending messages with encryption.
-   Creating communities.

September:

-   Explore part of Liberta
-   Advertising algorithm with client-side recommendations. (Advertisements will be prepared due to your interests WITH CLIENT-SIDE digital foot-prints.)

October:

-   Simplification steps (Getting rid of neoline, creating wallet inside app)

November:

-   Beginning of mobile app
-   Beginning of desktop app

## Simplification Steps

We know real people don't want to installing neoline, learning what is blockchain, and other boring technical stuff. So we want to make signing up easier than even traditional social media.

_Do you have existing wallet? Then enter your mnemonic phrase. You don't have? Then, what about creating a new wallet to register Liberta?_

## Team Information

Aşkın Kadir Çekim - Project Manager & Blockchain Developer Helin Çekim - Research and Development Burak Osman Yaldız - Front End Developer

## Technical Issues

We made the project's blockchain side with smart contracts with neo-one library. But the problem is we couldn't deploy it to blockchain because of the issues of .NET side of neo-one package.

Our codes are ready to go but our time was not enough to deploy and test it. So in the video, you can just see the front-end part of the project. If you want to see the smart contract codes, you can check the our GitHub repository.
